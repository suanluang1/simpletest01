Established in 1987 to commemorate King Bhumibol Adulyadej's (Rama IX) 60th birthday, this botanical paradise was officially opened by the King himself on December 1, 1987.\n\nMore than just a park, Suanluang Rama IX is a living tribute to the late King's dedication to environmental conservation and botanical research. The park features extensive botanical gardens, international-themed gardens, a serene lake, and pavilions showcasing the King's environmental initiatives.\n\nToday, the Suan Luang Rama IX Foundation manages this green sanctuary, ensuring it remains a place of education, recreation, and natural beauty for generations to come."}
